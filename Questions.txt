*  These are questions found on the web to practice
*  doing white board problems for interviews.
*  Each function should be commented with time complexity
*  using Big O notation. Have Fun! 


* Question 1 - Write a function to find the missing number 
* in 2 arrays with integers between 1-100 without using any
* built in comparison functions.
* Example: Array1 = {4, 12, 6, 8, 20}
* Array2 = {4, 8, 20, 12}
* Function should return 6 as the missing number 

* Question 2 - Find a duplicate number in a given array 
* Example: Array = {3, 6, 10, 11, 21, 3, 4, 2, 15}
* Your function should return 3 

* Question 2 Bonus - Find multiple duplicates and return them to be printed
* NOTE: the values are guaranteed to be 1-100 so anything outside should not
* be printed or returned */

* Question 3 - Find the largest and smallest number in an unsorted array 
* of values 1-100
* NOTE: Sorting the array is not allowed */

* Question 4 - Reverse an array of integers without using a built in
* reverse function from Java library. */

* Question 5 - Remove duplicate items from an array

* Question 6 - Find the middle element of a singly linked list

* Question 7 - Reverse the elements of a string without using any built-in 
* reverse functions.

* Question 8 - Reverse the string using recursion without using any built-in
* reverse functions.

* Question 9 - Reverse the words in a sentence string without using any
* built-in reverse functions. 

* Question 10 - Make a palindrome checker for a given word / string. Returns T/F
