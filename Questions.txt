*  These are questions found on the web to practice
*  doing white board problems for interviews.
*  Each function should be commented with time complexity
*  using Big\cf3 -\cf2 O notation. Have Fun! 



* Question 1 - Write a function to find the missing number 
* in 2 arrays with integers between 1-100 without using any
* built in comparison functions.
* Example: Array1 = {4, 12, 6, 8, 20}
* Array2 = {4, 8, 20, 12}
* Function should return 6 as the missing number */

* Question 2 - Find a duplicate number in a given array 
* Example: Array = \{3, 6, 10, 11, 21, 3, 4, 2, 15\}
* Your function should return 3 */\

* Question 2 Bonus - Find multiple duplicates and return them to be printed
* NOTE: the values are guaranteed to be 1-100 so anything outside should not
* be printed or returned */

* Question 3 - Find the largest and smallest number in an unsorted array 
* of values 1-100\cf0 \
* NOTE: Sorting the array is not allowed */

* Question 4 - Reverse an array of integers without using a built in
* reverse function from Java library. */
